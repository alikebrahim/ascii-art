# ASCII ART \*\*UNDER CONSTRUCTION\*\*

This is a simple implementation of an ascii art CLI application using golang. It's a learning process.

> go run . [TEXT] [BANNER]

The application currently supports text aligment to either center and right.

Try:

> go run . -j center [TEXT] [BANNER]


Available Banners:
